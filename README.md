User Stories:

1. As a user, I can see a homepage that tells me about the app, and allows me to create an account or log in.

2. As a user, I can log into my account, and see pictures of all of my pets and an option to add more pets. If I have no pets, there will be some text that says "It's feeling a little lonely in here.... Want to add a pet?" and a button that says "add pet".

3. As a user, I can see a card of each of my pets, with the following information:
   - A picture of the pet
   - The pet's name
   - The pet's age
   - The pet's enjoys
   - A button with the text 'see pet'
